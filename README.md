# Intelligent Computational Media
This repository contains the lecture materials and examples for Aalto University's Intelligent Computational Media course, instructed by [Perttu Hämäläinen](http://perttu.info) and [Koray Tahiroglu](http://mlab.taik.fi/~korayt/).

Check [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/search.php?search=intelligent+computational+media#menu4) to see when the course is run for the next time!

## Learning goals
The course covers AI and machine learning for games and audiovisual media.
* Understand how common AI algorithms & tools work
* Understand what the tools can be used for in context of art, media, and design
* Get hands-on practice of designing, implementing and/or using the tools

The first week of the course has introductory lectures, but the rest of the time is devoted to project work that can be done alone or together with a pair or group. The teachers will be there to provide
personalized assistance.

## Road to learning
Check the [lessons](Lessons/README.md) and browse the [code examples](Code/README.md). Also check the other repositories and links below.

**The field is changing rapidly and this course is constantly evolving. We will keep adding relevant resources and materials below, gradually incorporating them to the lectures as well.** Thus, if you want to stay updated, check back at this page every now and then.

## Overview & design philosophy
This is a crash course for deep learning and other AI techniques for people with **as little technical prerequisites as possible:**

* Basic programming skills (e.g., some  python, processing, or Unity C#)
* High-school math. We focus on visual explanations that are enough to understand why and how various AI methods work.

The focus is on **media processing and games**, which makes this particularly suitable for **artists and designers**.

NOTE: The visual pedagogy is heavily inspired by Bret Victor's [Kill Math Project](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/). Although advanced math is needed to prove things like the optimality of an algorithm, many AI methods are born out of visual intuitions. It is unfortunate that researchers must then encode these intuitions as math, which imposes on the reader the burden of decoding back to intuitions and understanding. Fortunately, this is slowly changing with new publication venues like [Distill](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/).

This course covers similar content as Gene Kogan's excellent NYU course [Neural Aesthetic](https://ml4a.github.io/classes/itp-F18/), with the following main differences:

* Designed to run as a 1 week full-day workshop or a 3-week intensive with sessions from 9am to 12am, Tuesday-Friday, according to Aalto Media Lab's usual study schedule. This more of a short crash course than a full semester one, and students willing to learn more should definitely check Kogan's course as well.

* More content on games, inherited from the [Computational Intelligence in Games](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/hamalap5/CIGCourse2018) course by Perttu Hämäläinen (Spring 2018, now discontinued)



### Primary resources
* [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) & [p5js](http://p5js.org/), the toolset that provides the fastest way to audiovisual AI coding in a [browser-based editor](https://editor.p5js.org), without installing anything. Works even on mobile browsers! [This example](https://editor.p5js.org/AndreasRef/sketches/r1_w73FhQ) uses a deep neural network to track your nose and draw on the webcam view.

* [Machine Learning for Artists (ml4a)](http://ml4a.github.io/), including many cool [demos](http://ml4a.github.io/demos/), many of them built using p5js and ml5js.  

* [Unity Machine Learning Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), a framework for using deep reinforcement learning for Unity. Includes code examples and blog posts.

* [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2), a YouTube channel with short and accessible explanations of AI and deep learning research papers.

* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), a YouTube channel with excellent visual explanations on math, including [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

* [Game AI Book](http://gameaibook.org/) by Togelius and Yannakakis

* [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. An excellent resource for digging deeper, for those that can handle some linear algebra, probability, and statistics.




### Unsorted resources and links
These are gradually worked into the lecture materials as well; we maintain this both as a backlog and as extra materials for self-study.
