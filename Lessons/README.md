# Prerequisites
Before you attend the class, you should do the following:

* Go through the selection of Two Minute Papers videos below to get an idea of the range of computational media applications possible with modern machine learning.

* To grasp the fundamentals of what neural networks are doing, watch episodes 1-3 of 3Blue1Brown's [neural network series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

* Prepare to add one slide to a shared Google Slides document (link provided at the first lecture) about your background and what kind of projects you want to work on. This will be useful for finding other students with similar interests and/or complementary skills.

# Syllabus
The lessons each include an online document with key insights and exercises, and link to lecture slides with more details. The lectures primarily utilize image processing examples (more suitable for lecture slides) and audio applications are covered in the exercises.

Day 1:
* [Introduction and motivation](Intro.md). Why one should rather co-create than compete with AI technology.
* [Neural networks, part 1](NeuralNetworks1.md). Basics of neural networks, focusing on discriminative models like image classification.
* [Tools and frameworks](Tools.md) Getting started with practical AI coding, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch, and ml5js.

Day 2:
* [Neural networks, part 2](NeuralNetworks2.md). From discriminative to generative models like GANs.
* [Audio exercises, part 1](Audio.md).

Day 3:
* [Neural networks, part 3](NeuralNetworks3.md). Sequential problems like text prediction and generations.
* [Audio exercises, part 2](Audio2.md)

Day 4:
* [Optimization, part 1](Optimization.md). Pretty much all AI is (mathematical) optimization. This first part deals with continuous-valued problems

Day 5:
* [Optimization, part 2](Optimization.md). The second part expands to discrete and sequential problems like deep reinforcement learning.
