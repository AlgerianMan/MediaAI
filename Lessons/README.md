Here's all you needed for your first few weeks of creative AI and ML experiments, with supplementary materials to support further learning.

## Before the course
* [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md). Make sure you go through these before the course.

## Lectures
The lessons each include lecture slides and/or a page with key insights and exercises. The lectures primarily utilize image processing examples (more suitable for lecture slides) and audio applications are mostly covered in the exercises.

Day 1:
* [Introduction and motivation](LectureSlides/course_intro.pdf). Why one should rather co-create than compete with AI technology.
* [Neural networks, part 1](LectureSlides/neural_networks_part1.pdf). Basics of neural networks, focusing on discriminative models like image classification.
* [Exercises](GettingStarted.md) Getting started with practical AI coding, with image and audio classification as the main "hello world" applications.

Day 2:
* [Neural networks, part 2](LectureSlides/neural networks_part2.pdf). From discriminative to generative models like GANs. How to imbue computers with audiovisual imagination?
* [Audio exercises, part 1](https://github.com/SopiMlab/DeepLearningWithAudio/blob/master/ICM_Audio/AudioExercises_part1/UsingWavegan.md).

Day 3:
* [Neural networks, part 3](LectureSlides/neural networks_part3.pdf). Sequential problems like text prediction and generation.
* [Audio exercises, part 2](https://github.com/SopiMlab/DeepLearningWithAudio/blob/master/ICM_Audio/AudioExercises_part2/AudioClassification.md)

Day 4:
* [Optimization, part 1](LectureSlides/optimization_part1.pdf). Pretty much all AI and ML is some form of (mathematical) optimization. We've already applied it when training neural networks; now it's the time to get a bit wider and deeper understanding. This first part deals with continuous-valued problems, focusing on two key algorithms: Adam and CMA-ES.
* Example: [Optimizing billiards trick shots in Unity](../Code/Unity/IntelligentPool)
* Jupyter notebook exercise: [Abstract Adversarial Image Optimization Using CMA-ES](../Code/Jupyter/CMA-ES_Art.ipynb)

Day 5:
* [Optimization, part 2]((LectureSlides/optimization_part2.pdf). This part of the optimization lecture explains Deep Reinforcement Learning, building on the visual and geometric intuitions of CMA-ES.
* [Optimization, part 3]((LectureSlides/optimization_part3.pdf). Optimizing action sequences through graph and tree search, which provides an alternative to Deep RL, especially if there is a finite set of possible actions, e.g., gamepad buttons to press.

## Supplementary material
* [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) & [p5js](http://p5js.org/), the toolset that provides the fastest way to creative AI coding in a [browser-based editor](https://editor.p5js.org), without installing anything. Works even on mobile browsers! [This example](https://editor.p5js.org/AndreasRef/sketches/r1_w73FhQ) uses a deep neural network to track your nose and draw on the webcam view. [This one](https://editor.p5js.org/genekogan/sketches/Hk2Q4Sqe4) utilizes similar PoseNet tracking to control procedural audio synthesis.

* [Machine Learning for Artists (ml4a)](http://ml4a.github.io/), including many cool [demos](http://ml4a.github.io/demos/), many of them built using p5js and ml5js.  

* [Unity Machine Learning Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), a framework for using deep reinforcement learning for Unity. Includes code examples and blog posts.

* [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2), a YouTube channel with short and accessible explanations of AI and deep learning research papers.

* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), a YouTube channel with excellent visual explanations on math, including [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

* [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/), an online course by University of Helsinki and Reaktor. Aalto students can also get 2 credits for this course. This is a course about the basic concepts, societal implications etc., no coding.

* [Game AI Book](http://gameaibook.org/) by Togelius and Yannakakis. PDF available.

* [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. An excellent resource for digging deeper, for those that can handle some linear algebra, probability, and statistics. PDF available.
