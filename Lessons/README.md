# Syllabus
This page links to all the materials.

## Before the course:
* [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) Make sure you go through these before the course.

## Lectures
The lessons each include an online document with key insights and exercises, and link to lecture slides with more details. The lectures primarily utilize image processing examples (more suitable for lecture slides) and audio applications are covered in the exercises.

Day 1:
* [Introduction and motivation](Intro.md). Why one should rather co-create than compete with AI technology.
* [Neural networks, part 1](NeuralNetworks1.md). Basics of neural networks, focusing on discriminative models like image classification.
* [Tools and frameworks](Tools.md) Getting started with practical AI coding, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of frameworks like Tensorflow, Pytorch, and ml5js.

Day 2:
* [Neural networks, part 2](NeuralNetworks2.md). From discriminative to generative models like GANs.
* [Audio exercises, part 1](Audio.md).

Day 3:
* [Neural networks, part 3](NeuralNetworks3.md). Sequential problems like text prediction and generations.
* [Audio exercises, part 2](Audio2.md)

Day 4:
* [Optimization, part 1](Optimization.md). Pretty much all AI is (mathematical) optimization. This first part deals with continuous-valued problems

Day 5:
* [Optimization, part 2](Optimization.md). The second part expands to discrete and sequential problems like deep reinforcement learning.

## Primary supplementary materials
* [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) & [p5js](http://p5js.org/), the toolset that provides the fastest way to audiovisual AI coding in a [browser-based editor](https://editor.p5js.org), without installing anything. Works even on mobile browsers! [This example](https://editor.p5js.org/AndreasRef/sketches/r1_w73FhQ) uses a deep neural network to track your nose and draw on the webcam view.

* [Machine Learning for Artists (ml4a)](http://ml4a.github.io/), including many cool [demos](http://ml4a.github.io/demos/), many of them built using p5js and ml5js.  

* [Unity Machine Learning Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), a framework for using deep reinforcement learning for Unity. Includes code examples and blog posts.

* [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2), a YouTube channel with short and accessible explanations of AI and deep learning research papers.

* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), a YouTube channel with excellent visual explanations on math, including [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

* [Game AI Book](http://gameaibook.org/) by Togelius and Yannakakis

* [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. An excellent resource for digging deeper, for those that can handle some linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
